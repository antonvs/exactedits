<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Operating as Exact Edits I do editing and proof-reading of
written English. I have a varied business background,including contulting in training and development so can 
work effectively in a number of <a href="experience">subject areas</a>. Recent 
work includes marketing material for a service industry client and training 
material on health and wellness. <a href="mailto:joan@exactedits.co.za">Email me</a>

<h3>Modus operandi</h3>

<p>
My aim is to work with you to produce an error-free document that gets your
message across clearly, is consistent, and pitched at an appropriate level for
your target audience. The changes I suggest serve to clarify, refine or enhance
the document, within your own or your organisation’s style. 
See <a href="services">Services</a> for the detail on what I can do for you. 
</p><p>
Initially I need to view a document to establish the amount of work required, 
discuss your purpose and aims, and the extent of my involvement before 
estimating costs.
</p><p>
I work with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>MS Word 2010 (compatible with earlier versions), using Track Changes</li>
<li>Editing-enabled PDF documents</li>
<li>British Standard proof-reading symbols on hard copy documents</li>
</ul>
<p> 
The word ‘<i>exact</i>’ means: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Precise</li>
<li>Accurate or correct in all details</li>
<li>Tending to be accurate and careful about minor details</i><sup>[1]</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hence the operating name Exact Edits, which sums up my approach to copy-editing
and proof-reading.
