<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Operating as <exact-edits/> I edit and proof-read written English. I have a varied business background, 
including consulting in training and development, so I work effectively in a number of
<a href="experience">subject areas</a>. Recent work includes marketing material for a service industry client and 
training material on health and wellness. Do <a href="mailto:joan@exactedits.co.za">email me</a> 
with any questions you may have.
</p>
<p>
<exact-edits/> is classified as an Exempt Micro Enterprise (EME) and a Level 4 Contributor to B-BBEE, so your company 
can claim at least 100% of its spend with me towards its own B-BBEE scorecard.
</p>

<h3>Modus operandi</h3>

<p>
I work with you to produce error-free documents that get your message across clearly, are consistent, 
and pitched at the right level for your target audience. Changes serve to clarify, refine or enhance 
documents, within your own or your organisation’s style. 
See <a href="services">Services</a> for the detail on what I can do for you. 
</p><p>
I prefer to view a document or a representative sample of it, then discuss what you want to achieve and the extent of 
my involvement, before estimating costs.
</p><p>
I work with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>MS Word 2010 (compatible with earlier versions), using Track Changes</li>
<li>Editing-enabled PDF documents</li>
<li>Proofreading marks and symbols (on hard copy documents).</li>
</ul>
<p>I use Skype by appointment only, and Dropbox to send and receive large documents.</p>

The operating name <exact-edits/> sums up my approach to copy-editing and
proofreading - with the advantage of my being careful about major issues
as well!
