<bind tag="subtitle">: Risks of self-editing</bind>

<h2>Why not self-edit?</h2>

<p>
It's not easy to pick up errors in one's own writing or in material that we 
have read again and again. 
</p>
<p>
The problem is that when our target audience picks up errors or inconsistencies, they begin to question 
the quality of the product or the credibility and expertise of the service provider.
</p>
<p>
So what we put out there can directly impact our response rate and hence our bottom line. 
</p>
<p>
Which means it is well worth employing a professional who makes the effort to 
understand our aims and obectives and who will help to ensure that the quality of
our written material matches that of our products and services. To help you 
make a choice, read my <a href="references">references</a> and more about my
