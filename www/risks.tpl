<h2>The risks of self-editing</h2>

<p>
It's not easy to pick up errors in one's own writing or in material that we 
have read again and again. 
</p>
<p>
The problem is that when the target audience picks up errors or inconsistencies,
they begin to question the credibility and expertise of the product or service 
provider. 
</p>
<p>
So what we put out there can directly affect the response rate and bottom line. 
</p>
<p>
Which means it is well worth employing a professional who makes the effort to 
understand your aims and obectives and who will help ensure that the quality of
your written material matches that of your products and services. To help you 
make a choice, read my <a href="references">references</a> and more about my
