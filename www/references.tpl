<li>From an email: “Thanks very much for the editing that you did on such short
notice. It was very good and saved me an afternoon for other work. I was
especially glad that you picked up the LSM footnote.” Consultant</li>

<li>From a testimonial: “Joan demonstrated an admirable proficiency in
proofreading work and took the initiative to address several systemic factors
which have the potential to improve the agency’s proofing capabilities in the
future. Joan showed herself to be technologically adept and was able to adapt
to procedural changes which occurred during the period in question.” Creative
Director/Copywriter</li>

<li>From a reference: “When the book was completed, Joan assisted with the
final editing and proof-reading thereof. She exhibited careful and
conscientious work, showing an eye for detail. Her command of the English
language is very good.  I can highly recommend Joan van Straaten for work in
writing and publishing. She is skilled and has a wide general knowledge. She
can work well in a team being always sensitive to the needs of others.”

<li>From a reference: "It was a huge task to compile the manual containing the
policies and procedures for the complete organisation including the functions
of procurement, production, health and safety, sales, marketing, logistics and
the support functions.  The initial work was done by an Italian colleague whose
mastery of the English language was not up to the standard required; with the
result that computer aided translation from Italian to English was done most of
the time.  The result was poor language while meaning and purpose got lost in
the translation quite often.
<p>
Joan van Straaten was recommended by a management consultant to do the editing
and proof-reading of the manual.  We communicated and exchanged documents
electronically because she was based in South Africa.  I was impressed with her
work, because she was quick, meticulous and skilful.  It was clear that she had
exceptional language and writing skills, was in control of word processing and
had the ability to structure a document professionally.
<p>
It is therefore a pleasure to recommend Joan for editing, proof-reading and
related work." Managing Director</li>
